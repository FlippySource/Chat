        @id: An identifier for the object. The value of each object id property should
             be unique with respect to the Content Directory.

        @parentID: id property of object’s parent. The parentID of the Content Directory ‘root’
                   container must be set to the reserved value of -1.  No other parentID
                   attribute of any other Content Directory object may take this value. 

        @childCount: Child count for the object. Applies to containers only.
        
        @restricted: When true, ability to modify a given object is confined to the
                     Content Directory. Control point metadata write access is disabled.

        @searchable: When true, the ability to perform a Search action under a container
                     is enabled, otherwise a Search under that container will return no
                     results. The default value of this attribute when if it is absent
                     on a container is false.
