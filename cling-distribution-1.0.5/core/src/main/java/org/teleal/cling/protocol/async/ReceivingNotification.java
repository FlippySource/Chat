/**
 * Handles reception of notification messages.
 * <p>
 * First, the UDN is created from the received message.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an <em>ALIVE</em> message has been received, a new background process will be started
 * running {@link org.teleal.cling.protocol.RetrieveRemoteDescriptors}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a <em>BYEBYE</em> message has been received, the device will be removed from the registry
 * directly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following was added to the UDA 1.1 spec (in 1.3), clarifying the handling of messages:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * "If a control point has received at least one 'byebye' message of a root device, embedded device, or
 * service, then the control point can assume that all are no longer available."
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Of course, they contradict this a little later:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * "Only when all original advertisements of a root device, embedded device, and services have
 * expired can a control point assume that they are no longer available."
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This could mean that even if we get 'byeby'e for the root device, we still have to assume that its services
 * are available. That clearly makes no sense at all and I think it's just badly worded and relates to the
 * previous sentence wich says "if you don't get byebye's, rely on the expiration timeout". It does not
 * imply that a service or embedded device lives beyond its root device. It actually reinforces that we are
 * free to ignore anything that happens as long as the root device is not gone with 'byebye' or has expired.
 * In other words: There is no reason at all why SSDP sends dozens of messages for all embedded devices and
 * services. The composite is the root device and the composite defines the lifecycle of all.
 * </p>
